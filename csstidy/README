CSSTidy

Changelog: http://csstidy.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/csstidy/trunk/

css_optimiser.php is the web-interface, css_parser.php contains the PHP class (CSSTidy).

This class represents a CSS parser which reads CSS code and saves it in an array.
In opposite to most other CSS parsers, it does not use regular expressions and
thus has full CSS2 support and a higher reliability. The downside of not using regular expressions
is a lower speed though.
Additional to that it applies some optimisations and fixes to the CSS code.
An online version should be available here: http://cdburnerxp.se/cssparse/css_optimiser.php
